        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jennifer Lopez-Barajas and I am a second year student at University of Riverside, California. I am currently undeclared but wanting to major in Linguistics and minor in child development and become a Pediatric Speech Pathologist. The skills I have acquired are patience, multitasking, communication, and team player. I am currently working at an elementary school in San Bernardino, California and I work there as a youth leader. The skills that I have acquired with this job are leadership, problem solving, adaptability, and creativity. I work with students ages four to twelve  which is a wide variety of ages so you have to know how to communicate with each and every one in a way that makes them all feel understood. That is my only job experience but I do have experience doing community service. I did community service for my local church and I helped in classes that were teaching children who were doing this first communion. I was sixteen years old at the time and the children were six to eleven years old. I have always loved working with children and this is why I would like to become a pediatric speech pathologist.<br><br>

        I am hoping to graduate from the University of Riverside, California with my bachelors degree in 2026. After this I am planning to go to the University of San Diego, California for my masters program. After this I will hopefully get my PhD but I am not sure of the program I would like to go to get this yet. My goal is to have my own clinic where my patients can come for their speech therapy and it would be a safe space for them and they would feel comfortable mostly because they are children that cannot communicate the same as other children. I would want them to feel safe enough to try.<br><br>

        My current accomplishments are graduating highschool with a gold honor roll and a 4.5 gpa. I also received the gold honor roll all through middle school and high school. In high school I took 5 AP classes and a few honor classes. I also joined many clubs like key club, positive vibes club, and book club.
